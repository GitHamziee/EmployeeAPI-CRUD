üõ†Ô∏è Backend-Focused Diary App (ASP.NET MVC / Web API)

This project is mainly focused on the backend implementation of a Diary Application. It demonstrates how to build and test a structured API using ASP.NET Core MVC with the following concepts:

Controllers for handling requests and routing

Dependency Injection (DI) for better maintainability and testability

Entities & DTOs for separating database models from exposed API contracts

Endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Swagger / OpenAPI integration for API testing and documentation

While the project also includes views for basic diary entry management, its main purpose is to highlight backend development practices, clean architecture, and API-first design.
